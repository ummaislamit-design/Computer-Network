Below are 3-4 short rationals bullets explaining with details:

1. The choosing of LAN Network: Because each branch is routed through within a 
limited area such as (CA and Austin branch) which paired with the departments Ethernet, 
Wi-Fi which included the computers, how many people are using it and the laptops, as well as the printer.

2. The Choosing of Tree Topology: One of the reasons is communication, when the workers work they
mostly communicate through teams, google meet, zoom and all other networks. This network is faster 
and simple to work and scalability is good for any corporate big companies. Different cross-functional 
teams from different states can communicate efficiently and travel through the backbone.

3.Lastly Tree topology networks balance cost if we compare it's very convenient than other topology 
because high quality with high complexity, moderate reliability for corporate companies with location 
we are in within the country.
